            A valid outcome of this proposal is just saying that after going
            back and forth many times, we think this decision is higher-level,
            presenting the information that has been shared here.
          </p>
          <p className="Text size-4 mb-3">
            We drilled down onto this problem and found out that it touches all
            products and not just Material UI. We cannot solve this problem in
            the Core realm.
          </p>
          <p className="Text size-4 mb-3">
            If a prototype would help the decision, I would be more than happy
            to do it. Iâ€™m sooo eager to stop discussing and start building at
            this point ðŸ˜… But even before prototyping, it would be good to have
            directions from the people who will make the decision: what
            information would they need? what should we prototype exactly?
          </p>
          <p className="Text size-4 mb-3">
            So, if wee agree on this, how should we present the information to
            the higher level? is it worth it even proposing something? how do we
            drive this need for direction forward?
