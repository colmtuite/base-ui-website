              A valid outcome of this proposal is just saying that after going
              back and forth many times, we think this decision is higher-level,
              presenting the information that has been shared here.

              We drilled down onto this problem and found out that it touches
              all products and not just Material UI. We cannot solve this
              problem in the Core realm.

              If a prototype would help the decision, I would be more than happy
              to do it. Iâ€™m sooo eager to stop discussing and start building at
              this point ðŸ˜… But even before prototyping, it would be good to
              have directions from the people who will make the decision: what
              information would they need? what should we prototype exactly?

              So, if we agree on this, how should we present the information to
              the higher level? is it worth it even proposing something? how do
              we drive this need for direction forward?
