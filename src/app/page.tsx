              We drilled down onto this problem and found out that it touches
              all products and not just Material UI. We cannot solve this
              problem in the Core realm.

              If a prototype would help the decision, I would be more than happy
              to do it. Iâ€™m sooo eager to stop discussing and start building at
              this point ðŸ˜… But even before prototyping, it would be good to
              have directions from the people who will make the decision: what
              information would they need? what should we prototype exactly?

            <p className="Text size-4 mb-3">
              So, if we agree on this, how should we present the information to
              the higher level? is it worth it even proposing something? how do
              we drive this need for direction forward?
